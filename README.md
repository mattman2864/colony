# Colony Game
## Overview
- You have control of a space colony on the recently discovered planet A598TAR, nicknamed A*.
- Your colony starts with only 3 inhabitants, though you will periodically recieve new inhabitants upon completing tasks.
- If you are unable to complete certain tasks within the specified time, the mission will be cancelled and your colony is over.
- You must manage oxygen, food, temperature, and water while keeping out dangerous predators and diseases.
- If all inhabitants of the colony die, the colony is over.

## Inhabitants
- Your inhabitants have various needs that need to be met.
- Some of these needs are **basic** needs, such as food, temperature, and water.
    - **Basic** needs are required for survival and if not met for prolonged periods of time they will die.
- Other needs are **comfort** needs, such as rest, socialization, and recreation.
    - **Comfort** needs are not required for survival, but can improve **efficiency** and reduce **stress**.
- Inhabitants can also get **sick**, which drastically reduces efficiency and, with some illnesses, can cause death.
- **Sick** duplicants can be treated with a variety of treatments depending on the illness.

## Creatures
- A* hosts a variety of creatures already on the planet.
- Some of these creatures are hostile, while others are passive.
    - Passive creatures can be tamed and ranched for resources.
    - Hostile creatures can also be tamed, and can be utilized for colony defense.

## Asteroids and Meteors
- Meteors will occasionally rain down in the form of a **meteor shower**, dropping rare metals and other resources, though they will also damage buildings if not protected.
- Once rocketry is unlocked, inhabitants can send **space drones** to travel to **meteors** in order to mine for rare metals.
